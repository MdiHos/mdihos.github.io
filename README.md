# Mahozad Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.6.
Make sure to first install Angular CLI with the command `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

It is possible to deploy directly to GitHub pages with the official
[angular-cli-ghpages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages) package.

To build or serve the application in production mode in IntelliJ, see [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/q/51127798).

To make the angular server available over local network (for example to access
it with mobile on the same network), see [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/q/43071535).

### Fonts
The main header uses a serif font called *Roboto Slab*.
Rest of the site uses the san-serif font *Roboto*.

These fonts are free and can be downloaded from [Google fonts site](https://fonts.google.com/).

Note that the woff2 version of those two fonts were obtained from third-party
sites (which may have created them by converting their original format to woff2).

Other serif fonts for the header:
  - Bitter **bold**
  - Exo **bold**
  - Gilroy **extra bold** (other wights were not free)
  - Karma **bold**
  - Philosopher **bold**

### Book previews
The link to readable previews of books is obtained from the Amazon book page ->
*Embed* link near the share buttons.
This link may not be shown for all formats of the book.
Change the book format, for example to *Kindle*, and see if that format has an
*Embed* link.

The embed links may redirect to the book page for Iran IP addresses.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
