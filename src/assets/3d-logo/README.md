First apply all the modifiers by selecting the object then seclting the modifiers panel (the wrench icon) and click on each of the modifiers arrow and select apply.

next, go to UV editing tab and press a to select all parts of the logo mesh and then press "u"
and select "smart uv project". set the island margin to 0.001 and click OK.

Go to shading tab and from top-left corner of one of the areas set its view to shader editor (blob icon).

on the image texture node, click new and enter 1024 by 1024 or higher resolution and click OK.

To create the object color texture, set the Metalic value in the Principled BSDF node to 0 and then in the render panel select difuse and bake. Restore the Metalic value to its original value for other bakes.

Another way to bake the color is to link the color output of ColorBump node from Base Color input of Principled BSDF node to Emission input of the Pincipled BSDF node and then bake "Emit" from the render settings and then restore that connection back to its original.

Bake other kind of texures (roughness, normal, etc.) as described in the YouTube video (links below).

To bake all the values combined, select "combined" from the bake type (no need to set metallic value of material to 0) (also select direct and indirect and all the other lighting options).
After the bake is complete and we save the image, create a new image texture node (or use the existing one)
and click the folder icon and select the image from disk. Then, the color output of this node should go 
to the color input of the Principled BSDF node (remove the other input links).

To edit curves and paths, select the path or curve and then go to edit mode by pressing Tab (or selecting edit mode from top-left corner)
To extend (add node) to a BÃ©zier curve select the curve or one of its nodes by dragging over it and press E.
To grab and move a node or a node handle, drag over it and press G.
To move the view, hold shift and drag the mouse middle button.
To connect two nodes together (fill), select both of them and press F or press Alt + C (close).
To set the exact position of a node, select it and then near the gizmo and the right toolbar drag the small arrow to the left to open the "Item" menu which contains the coordinates.
To change the starting node of a path or curve, first enable "Bsurface" addon from Edit -> preferences. Select the path and press tab to go to edit mode. select the desired note to be the first node. Then from near the gizmo on the top right drag the small arrow to the left to open the panel and then select the Edit tab and from the Bsurfaces section click "Set First Points".

We can simply animate position of the camera manually with no problem. However, to animate the camera along a path and then export the animation (bake) to gltf, see below links.
To animate the camera along a path see https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/46898 and https://youtu.be/mkD7S7wLx1I
(make sure to set the camera coordinates to 0,0,0 so it is placed on the path).
To export camera animation along a path see https://youtu.be/omAoKWyG_J4
(set the keyframes as close as possible so that when the animation is converted it takes less size. Bit it seems to make camera movement not so smooth. We can then set the animation speed in three.js however we want). Also, baking seems to have the advantage that it does not require `camera.lookAt(...)` to be set in every frame of Three.js animation.

If the object lighting in three.js is not good, try to change the toneMapping and/or tweak toneMappingExposure of the three.js renderer.

## Environments
Some environment files were taken from Blender.

They are available in <blender-install-path>\datafiles\studiolights\world\

### Shadows
Environment maps (HDRIs) do not cast shadow. Or in other words: They can be used in combination with shadow mapping
(see [this post](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/shadow-problem-with-env-map/16871/3)).
To show shadows in Three.js see below links:

Before baking, select Non-Color as the color space of the image texture node.
OR select sRGB as the color space of the image texture node to produce subtler shadows.

To bake, remember to disconnect the image texture node output first to or a total black result is produced.
After baking is finished, remember to connect the output of the image texture node!

Make sure to turn the "roughness" and "metallic" of the Principled BSDF node to 1 so
the shadows are shown for all frames of the animation correctly.

We can save a frame of the animation from Chrome by right-clicking on the image and saving it.
The render sample count for ambient occlusion matters.

To make the shadows a little more interesting and noisy set a low sample count (`20`) in 
the render settings. I used `2048`.
